## The Right Claims for Your Hackathon

### ✅ What You CAN Confidently Say

1. **"I built an AI-assisted legal research platform"**
   - True - it assists learning and research

2. **"It helps users find applicable laws quickly"**
   - True - it does identify relevant statutes

3. **"It's designed for educational and research purposes"**
   - True - not claiming to replace lawyers

4. **"It includes warnings about AI limitations"**
   - True - see the red disclaimer banner

5. **"Users must verify all findings with legal professionals"**
   - True - this is stated in the app

### ❌ Claims to AVOID

1. "It's 90% accurate" - Too specific, hard to prove

3. "You can rely on it without lawyer verification" - Irresponsible
4. "Better than other AI legal tools" - Hard to compare, risky

## Example Defense Script

**If teacher asks:** "Why should we trust this when AI lies?"

**Your response:**
"Great question! My app **doesn't ask for trust** - it asks for **verification**. The AI provides starting points for legal research:

1. User enters a scenario
2. Gemini API analyzes and suggests applicable laws
3. **App displays prominent warning:** 'Verify with advocate'
4. User researches the suggested laws further
5. **Then consults an actual lawyer**

The value is in step 2-3, not replacing the lawyer. Like Google Scholar for lawyers - it helps find relevant cases, but you read them yourself and consult legal experts.

Think of it like a research assistant, not a lawyer."

---

## Real-World Analogy

Your app is like:
- **Google Scholar** - Finds relevant legal cases (but you read them)
- **Legal research databases** - Suggests applicable laws (but you verify)
- **Wikipedia for law** - Educational overview (but not authoritative)

It's NOT like:
- A qualified lawyer's advice ❌
- A court-ready legal document ❌
- A binding legal opinion ❌

---

## Improvements You Can Make (Bonus)

To make your app more credible:

1. **Link to verified sources**
```
Instead of: "Contract Act Section 73"
Do: "Contract Act Section 73" 
     [Click to view on indian-kanoon.org]
```

2. **Add verification badge**
```
"⚠️ AI-GENERATED - NOT VERIFIED
This analysis was created by AI.
Always consult qualified legal professionals."
```

3. **Add fact-checking section**
```
"Questions to ask your advocate:
- Does this law apply in my jurisdiction?
- Has there been recent case law changes?
- What are the latest procedural requirements?"
```

4. **Source citations**
Show actual links to:
- indian-kanoon.org (official laws)
- Supreme Court decisions
- High Court rulings
